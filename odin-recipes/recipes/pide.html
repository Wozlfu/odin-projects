            <ol style="text-align:left; color: azure;">
                <li>For the dough, take dry yeast and granulated sugar in a deep bowl, add warm water on top, mix and leave on one side for 10 minutes to rise.</li>
                <li>Then add oil on top and beat with a whisk. Then add 2 cups of flour and salt and start kneading.</li>
                <li>Add the remaining 1 glass of water in a controlled manner and knead until you get a dough that does not stick to the hand. You need to knead for about 5 minutes. After kneading, cover and leave to ferment for 45 minutes in a warm place.</li>
                <li>While the dough is fermenting, prepare the stuffing. For internal mortar; Finely chop the onion, tomatoes and peppers and mix them with the minced meat. Grate the garlic, add the oil and water, add the spices and mix well. Your stuffing is ready.</li>
                <li>Take the dough that has been fermented, stretch it lightly on the counter like yogurt and a cylinder, and cut it into 6 equal parts.</li>
                <li>Knead each piece with your hands, roll it and roll it out with the help of a rolling pin, in the shape of a pita and depending on the size of your tray, the thinner you roll, the better.</li>
                <li>On a greased and floured baking tray, cool the dough you have prepared and distribute the mortar you have prepared on top of them.</li>
                <li>Close the edges by curling and press well so that it does not open while cooking. Beat the egg yolk with the oil and brush the edges with the help of a brush.</li>
                <li>Bake in a preheated 200-degree oven for about 12 minutes until the edges are browned. As soon as they come out of the oven, butter the edges and if you want a softer pita, cover them with a clean cloth. If you like it crispy, don't cover it. Serve after the initial heat has passed.</li>
